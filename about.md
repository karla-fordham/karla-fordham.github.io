I grew up in South Auckland and attended Manurewa High School. I then went on to attend Massey University to complete a Bachelor of Design majoring in Visual Communication. I am half Filipino and grew up in a diverse community with a family of contrasting cultures. My upbringing taught me how essential culture and diversity is, especially in the work place.

If I could sum up my learnings as a designer so far, the key takeaway I’ve learnt is to **fail often and fail fast**. Ask all the questions. Say all the things. Don’t over think it. Listen to feedback. Take action.

Design has been perceived as a profession where we are viewed as introverts who sit in a corner and produce magic. Design is not that at all. Design is an evolving process of iteration, collaboration, feedback, testing and **solving problems**.
