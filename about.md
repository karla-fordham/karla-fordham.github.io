I am half Filipino/Lebanese. I grew up in South Auckland where I attended Manurewa High School and went on to attend Massey University to complete a Bachelor of Design majoring in Visual Communication. Growing up in a diverse community with a family of contrasting cultures has taught me how essential culture and diversity is, especially in the work place.

As a designer, I’ve learnt about the importance of collaboration, the process of iteration, and the value of emotional intelligence. The key takeaway I’ve learnt is to fail often and fail fast. Ask all the questions. Say all the things. Don’t over think it. Listen to feedback. Take action.
