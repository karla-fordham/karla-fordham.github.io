**Things I've done:**
* Improved the way we work with developers, PMs and other stakeholders by improving our workflow
* Converted from Photoshop to Sketch
* Create component library/style guide
* Remove need for tedious mark up files
* Started using InVision for prototypes
* Converted existing and outdated EDMs from hard code to simple drag and drop in Mailchimp to allow for efficiency and ease of use for non-technical users in the business. This also improved responsiveness and display on OS, mail servers and device types
* Create user personas
